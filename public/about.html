<h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
<p> As a web developer, I am passionate about creating functional, responsive, and user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems. With a solid foundation in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks such as React and Vue.js, I aim to craft seamless user experiences that are both visually appealing and technically sound. I focus on accessibility, performance, and responsiveness to ensure that every user, regardless of device or ability, enjoys a smooth interaction.</p>

<p>On the back end, I work with tools like Node.js, Express, and databases such as MongoDB and MySQL to build robust and scalable web applications. I enjoy collaborating with designers, developers, and clients to bring ideas to life, from concept to launch. My experience in building a wide range of projects—from personal portfolios to dynamic e-commerce platforms—has equipped me with the versatility to tackle challenges across the full development stack.</p>

<p>I am always eager to learn new technologies to stay current in this fast-evolving field. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that aligns with best industry practices. My goal is not only to build websites but also to ensure they perform well, remain secure, and offer meaningful, engaging experiences to users. Problem-solving, continuous learning, and adaptability are at the core of my professional ethos as a developer.
